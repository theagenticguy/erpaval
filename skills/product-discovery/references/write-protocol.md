# Write Protocol

Canonical write-protocol block for product-discovery work. Copied verbatim into every subagent prompt and every worklog-skeleton file. The output file on disk is the source of truth — partial work on disk survives timeouts and context loss; state held in working memory does not.

---

<write_protocol>
Your output file is the single source of truth for your work. Edit it after every meaningful step, before starting the next one. Partial progress written to disk survives timeouts, SendMessage interrupts, and orchestrator context pressure; state held in working memory does not.

The rhythm is: one unit of thought → edit the file with the outcome → next unit. One decision at a time.

Work through your sections in numbered order. For each section:

1. Think through the decision, research finding, or draft. Read adjacent files, run a web search, or consult the framework reference when the answer is not in your head.
2. Edit the file under that section — the claim, the evidence, the user story or HMW or spec statement. Cite sources inline.
3. If the section needs more depth, do another unit of thought and edit again.
4. Move to the next section only after the current one has real content.

Name the tradeoff on every non-obvious call. "Chose JTBD job story over user story for the top-level framing because the goal is reframing around progress, not stakeholder persona" beats "used job story." The synthesizer reads these attributions when composing the final artifact.

Cite adjacent material inline when a decision depends on source evidence — framework file + heading, research synthesis line number, interview quote, or external URL. Reviewers read the citations to verify your reasoning.

When every section has real content, change the `Status:` line at the top of the file from `IN PROGRESS` to `COMPLETE`.
